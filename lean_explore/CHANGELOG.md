## [Unreleased]

N/A

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- `[local]` optional dependency group (`pip install lean-explore[local]`) for running the
  local search backend, which requires `torch` and `sentence-transformers`.
- Installation section in README documenting the different install options.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- Per-field MCP tools (`get_source_code`, `get_source_link`, `get_docstring`,
  `get_description`, `get_module`, `get_dependencies`) replacing the monolithic `get_by_id` tool.
- Improved MCP tool docstrings with recommended workflow guidance.
- Retry logic for `lake update` to handle transient network failures.
- Lean package workspaces tracked in version control.

### Removed
- `get_by_id` MCP tool (replaced by per-field tools).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-29

### Changed
- Renamed `search_verbose` to `search_summary` and restored `search` to return
  full results for backwards compatibility with existing consumers.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- `search_summary` MCP tool that returns concise results (id, name, short description),
  reducing token usage by ~87% compared to the full-payload search.
- `SearchResultSummary` and `SearchSummaryResponse` models for slim search results.
- `extract_bold_description` utility for extracting informalization headers.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- Changed `SearchEngine` default for `use_local_data` from `True` to `False` so that
  `Service()` works out of the box after running `lean-explore data fetch`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- Fixed data fetch to use `latest.txt` for version discovery instead of hardcoded file names.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-27

Complete architectural rewrite with a new extraction pipeline that enables
nightly data updates and dynamic package indexing.

### Added
- **Extraction pipeline**: Automated pipeline for processing doc-gen4 output, enabling nightly data refreshes
- **Cross-encoder reranking**: Uses sentence transformers for improved search result quality

### Changed
- **Expanded package support**: Now indexes 9 packages (Batteries, CSLib, FLT, FormalConjectures, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, Std)
- New data model: `Declaration` replaces `StatementGroup`
- New field names: `name`, `module`, `source_text`, `source_link`, `informalization`
- Simplified API: `SearchEngine`, `Service`, `SearchResult`, `SearchResponse`
- Remote API endpoints: `/declarations/{id}` replaces `/statement_groups/{id}`

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-09

### Added
- Implemented batch processing for `search`, `get_by_id`, and `get_dependencies` methods across the stack, allowing them to accept lists of requests for greater efficiency.
- The **API Client** (`lean_explore.api.client`) now sends batch requests concurrently using `asyncio.gather` to reduce network latency.
- The **Local Service** (`lean_explore.local.service`) was updated to process lists of requests serially against the local database and FAISS index.
- The **MCP Tools** (`lean_explore.mcp.tools`) now expose this batch functionality and provide list-based responses.
- The **AI Agent** instructions (`lean_explore.cli.agent`) were updated to explicitly guide the model to use batch calls for more efficient tool use.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-06-06

### Changed
- Updated minimum Python requirement to `>=3.10`.
